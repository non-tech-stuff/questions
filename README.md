# questions
Any and all questions I have. This can act as a starting point for things in my life.

# Motivation
I have many questions, some are directly stimulated by external events, others are more internal (in my mind).

It might be helpful to store questions and answers.

There's no boundary to the questions I ask.

# How do I store all questions I have?

Well there're two places to ask questions:
1. In my knowledge repo concerning a topic. They're store in the repo itself.
2. Questions that cannot be or hard to categorize are stored in this repo.

In short, to get a list of all questions:
1. Traverse my (PKB) repos and collect all the questions from (FIXME) tags.
2. Traverse my activity_logger and collect questions from there.
3. Finally collect questions from this repo.

That's all.
