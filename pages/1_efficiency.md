# 1. Need, use and disadvantages of efficiency.
Created Sunday 14 August 2022

### Question

- What does efficiency mean - is it economical, or a fundamental trait should value in all our work?
- Is being efficient without economical effects a waste of our resources?
- What are we trying to actually optimize, at the root of an economic system, by optimizing for the sake of economic success?
- Is need efficiency directly (2-way bound) related to economical efficiency, i.e. if we optimize a process - does it optimize the economic system and personal/organizational economy, and vice-versa, i.e. does optimizing personal/organization economy really helps in optimizing the process at hand, and also optimizing work done by others in society?
- Many things today in this world, according to my guess, are _made_ and though of only if economical costs are involved? Isn't this a bad way to think about efficiency?
- Should we spend optimizing all that we do? Practically, this may not be the best use of our personal time. If not, then how do we measure a _coefficient of need_ of efficiency?

### Opinion

- I think efficiency should be kept in mind even when one doesn't know about the economical aspects. Everything one does is used by someone else in society, mostly, and keeping not optimizing (or not even trying to optimize) the work one does will have effects on the efficiency of other people. This may be ignored if only self-economical aspects are kept in mind. But this can have ripple effects from external products/services we use and we'll in-return also get unoptimized stuff, maybe even for a higher price.
- I think we should value efficiency in everything we do because we have limited time (death, however distant), and we should try to maximize the net positive _impact_ we can have in our own life. This will translate into net _positive_ impact on others too, even if we don't do it actively.
