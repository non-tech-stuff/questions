Created Sunday 14 August 2022

### Question

- What does efficiency mean - is it economical, or a fundamental trait should value in all our work?
- Is being efficient without economical effects a waste of our resources?
- What are we trying to actually optimize, at the root of an economic system, by optimizing for the sake of economic success?
- Is need efficiency directly (2-way bound) related to economical efficiency, i.e. if we optimize a process - does it optimize the economic system and personal/organizational economy, and vice-versa, i.e. does optimizing personal/organization economy really helps in optimizing the process at hand, and also optimizing work done by others in society?
- Many things today in this world, according to my guess, are _made_ and though of only if economical costs are involved? Isn't this a bad way to think about efficiency?
- Should we spend optimizing all that we do? Practically, this may not be the best use of our personal time. If not, then how do we measure a _coefficient of need_ of efficiency?
